/*
Variables are container to store a value.In another way of definition, variables are called the title of a reserved memory location.
for example:
    int num = 10;
here:
    int is called the dataType
    num is called variable name
    = called operator
    10 is called value which assigned in num variable
    System.out.println("The value is "+num); --> here + is concat string with number

Rules while creating variables
1. variable name must start with letters,dollar character($) or UnderScore(_).
2. variable name can't start with number or any other special characters(!,@,#,%).
3  variable name can't be a reserved keyword in java. Like (break,if,while,continue).
4. variable name must be meaningful.
5. variable name  can't contain white-spaces.
